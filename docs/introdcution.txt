Project aims to predict 25 songs from species (birds and frogs) from 60 second sound files recorded in the rainforest.
The data was annotated by hand and is available from https://www.kaggle.com/c/rfcx-species-audio-detection.

The principle path in the project is to extract snippets from the sound recordings, transform them with fft, and
identify the power spectra with classification architectures like resnet.

The data is loaded from local files in the 'data' module. Transformations and other basic operations can be found in
'helpfun'. The neural network models are described in 'models'

A minimal data sample is stored in 'sampledata', which can be used for developement. The complete data set can be
downloaded over kaggle.
